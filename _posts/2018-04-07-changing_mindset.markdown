After many years working in IT, I decided that I should switch my Career a bit. I have held many jobs as PM, SDET Manager and Java Developer. I have help QA/SDET Management position for about 7 years stright in my career and got comfortable doing Automation with Java/JavaScript- Selenium. 

I tried teaching myself but it all fell short as I was on my own with some Udemy courses and Table of Contents that I simply skimmed over. I got started there, however, I would skip to solution sections after giving up. I got in a habit of just looking up the solutions and realized if the same question came up again, I couldn't code the answer. What I needed was a hard stop and lessons that don't let you move on unless I find the solution on your own. 

I signed up for Flatiron and so far the lessons has been very easy and I am sure it will start getting difficult. I will have to come up with the solutions if I want to move on to next lesson. I will get in a habit of developing my own code rather than moving on and giving up.
